Detailed Instructions:
-----------------------------------
See http://www.openanzo.org/projects/openanzo/wiki/OpenAnzoInstallation31
for the latest, most comprehensive and up-to-date instructions.

Quick Start:
-----------------------------------
The server is configured by default to store its data in an in-memory embedded
relational database. This is useful for quick experimentation but it means
that all data in the server will be lost when the server is shut off.
For data to be persisted, you must configure the server to use another relational
database. More information about how to do that is in the configuration section below.

Start the server by running (in Windows)
	openanzo-3.2.0/bin/startAnzo.bat
or (in unix)
	openanzo-3.2.0/bin/start.sh

When startup is complete, you should see the message:
	osgi-> All Currently Registered OpenAnzo services started.

You can see the status of the running OSGi bundles by visiting:
http://localhost:8080/status

And you can check to see if the server is working by visiting:
http://localhost:8080/validation
