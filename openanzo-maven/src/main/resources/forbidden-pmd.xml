  	Open Anzo PMD rules that are enforced by the regression build
  </description>
  
  <!--
    Adding a rule:
    
    	A rule should not be added to this file until there are zero violations in the build.  Nor
    	should rules be added at the whim of a single developer please first propose to the rule for 
    	inclusion (except rules agreed upon in initial design meetings..  they are all far game).
    	If there is agreement that the rule should be included the following steps are recommended:
    	
    	1.  There is consensus the rule should be added.
    	
    	1.  If the rule is not already in reported-pmd.xml, add it immediately.
    	
    	2.  Mail developers alerting them of the new rule and of your intention to put the rule in forbidden-pmd.xml. 
    		Ask developers to coordinate with you so multiple developers aren't spending time fixing the same violations.
    	
    	3.  Once all violations have been fixed, move the rule from reported-pmd.xml to this file and check in both
    		files.
    		
    Removing rules:
    	A rule should only be removed if there is consensus the rule should be removed.
    	
    	A good reason to remove a rule might be:
    	
    	1.	There is a bug in the rule causing it to break the build is a way that is unreasonably cumbersome to work around.
    	
    	2.  The rule does not cover some important aspect of the concept it attempts to enforce.  For example, a unused import
    		rule should realize that javadoc also requires imports, if the rule does not respect this, it should not be in this
    		file.
    	
    	Please consider moving the rule to reported-pmd.xml rather that removing entirely.
